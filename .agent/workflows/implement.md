# /implement — Implement a Planning Document

Execute an approved planning document item by item. Supports resuming across conversation boundaries — reads doc status to pick up where left off.

**Input**: Planning doc path (status must be `Approved` or `In Progress`)
**Output**: Code changes, progress tracked in source doc, blocked items flagged

## SDLC Pipeline

**Full path**: `/plan` → **`/implement`** → `/close`
**Lightweight**: `/capture` (self-contained) | `/hotfix` (fast-track)

**You are here**: `/implement` — executing the approved plan

## Steps

### 1. Load the document and plan

**If a source doc path was provided**, read it and check the frontmatter `> Status:` line:

- **`Approved`**: Fresh start — set status to `In Progress` and begin
- **`In Progress`**: Resuming — scan the `## Progress` section (see step 2) to identify what's already done vs remaining
- **`Draft` or `Planned`**: Tell user: "This doc needs planning. Run `/plan`."
- **`Done`**: Tell user: "This doc is already done. Run `/close` to file it."
- **Anything else**: Tell user which step to run based on the status.

**If no source doc was provided** (e.g., `/implement` invoked from conversation after an in-chat `/plan`):

1. Check if an implementation plan artifact exists in the brain directory
2. If it does, **create the source doc first** using the same structure as `/plan` step 7 — this is the permanent record in `docs/`. Use datetime-prefixed naming: `docs/YYYY-MM-DDTHHMM--<slug>.md`. Populate it from the implementation plan artifact. Set status to `Approved`.
3. If no artifact exists either, tell user: "No plan found. Run `/plan` first."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The source doc must exist before any code is touched.** If planning happened in conversation without writing the doc, `/implement` writes it as its first action.

If an implementation plan artifact exists in the brain directory, load it to understand the reconciliation and work plan. If not, create one using the same structure as `/plan` step 4.

### 2. Mark the source document and initialize progress tracking

// turbo

- Set the source document's status to `In Progress` (if not already)
- If the source document has a Decisions section, sync decisions from the artifact into it
- **Add a `## Progress` section** to the source document (if it doesn't exist):

```markdown
## Progress

| Phase | Status   | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | ----- |
| 1     | ⬜ Ready |       |
| 2     | ⬜ Ready |       |
```

Phase statuses: `⬜ Ready` | `🔧 In Progress` | `✅ Done` | `🚫 Blocked` | `🗑️ Debt`

This table is the **single source of truth** for resumption.

### 3. Implement iteratively

Work through items from the Progress table. **Before touching any code**, triage for parallelism.

#### Parallelism triage (MANDATORY — do this first)

Scan the Work Plan table for `parallel:X` annotations:

1. **Parallel groups exist**: dispatch subagents FIRST, then work on sequential items while agents run.
2. **No annotations**: ask — "Could any phases run independently?" (different files = candidate). If yes, annotate and dispatch.
3. **Everything sequential**: proceed to sequential items.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dispatch parallel work before starting sequential work.** Pattern: dispatch agents → work on non-conflicting sequential items → check agent results when done.
>
> If you choose NOT to dispatch for `parallel:X` phases, note why in the Progress table.

#### Sequential items (default)

- Pick next `⬜ Ready` or `🔧 In Progress` item
- Set status to `🔧 In Progress` → implement → verify → set `✅ Done`

#### Parallel items

When Work Plan has `parallel:X` annotations:

1. **Group** `⬜ Ready` items sharing the same annotation
2. **Validate file isolation** — no shared files between items. If overlap, fall back to sequential.
3. **Select model** per phase — see `core-parallel-evaluation.md` for tiers
4. **Health check** — `--status` / `--stats` to decide dispatch strategy (`ok` → full batch, `slow` → 1 at a time, `saturated` → do it yourself, `success_rate < 0.7` → sequential)
5. **Dispatch** — use `--batch` (preferred) or single dispatch. See `core-parallel-evaluation.md` for syntax and prompt tips.
6. **Work while agents run** — never idle-poll. If nothing to do, implement the tasks yourself.
7. **Review** — `git diff` each modified file. Verify changes match phase description and acceptance criteria.
8. **Handle outcomes**: acceptable → keep; minor issues → fix inline; wrong approach → revert (`git checkout -- <files>`), re-dispatch (max 2 retries, then sequential).
9. **Verify** — run test suite after entire batch accepted.
10. **On success**: mark `✅ Done`. **On failure**: revert batch, re-implement sequentially.

If any dispatch returns exit code 2 (`QUEUE_FULL`): do that work yourself.

**Between items**, briefly report progress (completed, next, blockers).

### 4. Handle test failures

- **Caused by your changes**: Fix inline as part of the current phase. Do NOT park as debt.
- **Pre-existing**: Note but don't fix — outside scope.
- **Design issues**: Stop and discuss with user before proceeding.

Include test file updates as part of the phase they belong to — no separate "fix tests" phase.

### 5. Handle blockers

When an item cannot be completed (missing dependency, undecided architecture, out of scope, external blocker):

**Do NOT skip silently.** Flag to user, confirm parking. Mark `🚫 Blocked` or `🗑️ Debt` with notes.

### 6. File discovered issues as debt (do NOT fix inline)

Encountered code that looks wrong but is unrelated to your task:

1. Create a debt doc in `docs/` with `> Status: Debt` and datetime-prefixed naming
2. Describe problem, impact, suggested fix. Link to parent doc if applicable.
3. Continue current work — do NOT fix inline.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never fix discovered issues inline** (scope creep). **Never just mention them in chat** (gets lost). One debt doc per issue, filed immediately.

### 7. Session boundary (if stopping mid-work)

// turbo

- Ensure Progress table is current (✅ completed, 🔧 current with stop-point note)
- Status stays `In Progress`

Next session: `/implement` same doc → resumes from Progress table.

### 8. Run PHPStan (mandatory gate)

After all phases complete and tests pass:

// turbo

```bash
make phpstan
```

**Hard gate** — do not report completion with errors. Fix errors in touched files inline. Pre-existing errors in untouched files: note but don't fix. Repeat until clean.

### 9. Report completion

Summarize: items completed, items parked as debt, follow-up actions.

Tell the user: `Implementation complete. Run /close docs/<filename>.md to finalize.`
