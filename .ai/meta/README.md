# Meta Guidance

This directory documents how to manage the DotAI policy hub itself. Editors and automation should consult these files before modifying policies.

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – workflow for proposing, reviewing, and merging policy updates.
- `CHANGELOG.md` – timeline of notable policy additions, removals, or breaking edits.
- `VERSIONING.md` – optional future file for semantic policy versioning (placeholder).
