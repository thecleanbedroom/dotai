# Policy Versioning

Policies follow calendar-based tagging (`YYYY.MM`), aligned with release trains for the associated VS Code extension pack. When introducing breaking changes (e.g., removing a required guideline), bump the minor segment and document upgrade notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

| Policy Tag | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 2025.12    | Active | First structured taxonomy rollout. |
